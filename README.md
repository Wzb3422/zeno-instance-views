# Zeno Instance Views

Modular data instance views for Zeno.
Views added to the `views.json` file will be made available in Zeno.

## Development

You can use the `template-svelte` cookiecutter to create a new instance view:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/zeno-ml/instance-views --directory template-svelte
```
